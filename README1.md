This program is a hot mess! it is a test of your ability to deal with glitches and 
focus long enough to reset the bar to its origin. If you miss it the program will (hopefully ) scream at you until you get it right. 
the moment it hits the diamond it will reset and begin its scream. the only way to get your revenge is to figure out how to break the entire system...
 at which point it will usually momentarially draw you a duck... not a good duck... but what do you expect from a tilt machine??
 i hope you enjoy!!! designed by Thomas George:
